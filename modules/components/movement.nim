class(UMovementComponent of UActorComponent, header: "GameFramework/MovementComponent.h"):
  ## UCLASS(ClassGroup=Movement, abstract, BlueprintType)
  ## MovementComponent is an abstract component class that defines functionality for moving a PrimitiveComponent (our UpdatedComponent) each tick.
  ## Base functionality includes:
  ##   - Restricting movement to a plane or axis.
  ##   - Utility functions for special handling of collision results (SlideAlongSurface(), ComputeSlideVector(), TwoWallAdjust()).
  ##   - Utility functions for moving when there may be initial penetration (SafeMoveUpdatedComponent(), ResolvePenetration()).
  ##   - Automatically registering the component tick and finding a component to move on the owning Actor.
  ## Normally the root component of the owning actor is moved, however another component may be selected (see SetUpdatedComponent()).
  ## During swept (non-teleporting) movement only collision of UpdatedComponent is considered, attached components will teleport to the end location ignoring collision.

  var updatedComponent: ptr USceneComponent
    ## The component we move and update.
    ## If this is null at startup and bAutoRegisterUpdatedComponent is true, the owning Actor's root component will automatically be set as our UpdatedComponent at startup.
    ## @see bAutoRegisterUpdatedComponent, SetUpdatedComponent(), UpdatedPrimitive

    ## UPROPERTY(BlueprintReadOnly, DuplicateTransient, Category=MovementComponent)

  var updatedPrimitive: ptr UPrimitiveComponent

  var moveComponentFlags: EMoveComponentFlags
    ## Flags that control the behavior of calls to MoveComponent() on our UpdatedComponent.

  var planeConstraintNormal: FVector
    ## The normal or axis of the plane that constrains movement, if bConstrainToPlane is enabled.
    ## If for example you wanted to constrain movement to the X-Z plane (so that Y cannot change), the normal would be set to X=0 Y=1 Z=0.
    ## This is recalculated whenever PlaneConstraintAxisSetting changes.

    ## If true, whenever the updated component is changed, this component will enable or disable its tick dependent on whether it has something to update.
